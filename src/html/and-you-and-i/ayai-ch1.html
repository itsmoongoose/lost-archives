                <h3>Chapter 1: Owner of a Lonely Heart</h3>
                <p>
                    It all started in a bar. Not in an evil villain's lair, or atop a high-speed train, or in any other sort of crazy death-defying situation you may care to think of. No, it all started in a common, everyday public bar. A nice, trendy, semi-upmarket establishment. The kind with chrome and black leather bar stools, comfortable booths along the walls and an assortment of well-spaced tables and chairs dotted around the centre of the room.

                    Kim Possible, hero, world saviour and much more sat on the padded stool at the end of the bar; elbows resting on its clean black surface. She would have preferred one of the booths, away from prying eyes, but was far too polite to hog one all by herself. Clad in loose-fitting blue jeans, a fitted green t-shirt and ankle-high brown suede boots with a three-inch heel, she gave off an air of someone desperately trying to blend into the décor. To avoid attention at all costs. In fact, that was exactly why she had chosen this particular location in which to drink and mope. A) The average patron had enough tact and perception to notice if you wanted to be left alone or not and B) none of her friends would be willing to pay the mark-up on the drinks; if they even got served at all.

                    <em>The perks of being me.</em> It was a bittersweet voice that piped up inside Kim's head, as she stared morosely at the dregs of a faint green liquid inside her glass. Picking it up, she downed the last of her apple sours and lemonade. She had done favours for so many people in her mid-teenage years that there existed an entire clutch of bars, clubs and restaurants that were willing to look the other way for her; and that was just in Middleton. Yeah, those olive-green eyes, pretty smile and fiery red hair opened doors and opportunities that your average underage college-age student could only dream of. Indeed, she had a sneaking suspicion that it was the only reason her friends still kept inviting her to go out with them. <em>I've not exactly been Miss fun and outgoing when I've been home of late.</em> She snorted at her own thought of, 'at late'. Try the past few months… at least.

                    Raising her head, Kim signalled the barman for another drink and delved into the pocket of her baggy jeans to fish out her purse so she could pay for it. While most of her usual haunts would happily give her free drinks without her even needing to turn on the charm, she always insisted on paying. They were already doing her a favour and risking trouble with the law by serving her in the first place, so she would not see them out of pocket too. She handed over the correct change to the man when he set the glass down in front of her. The night was still relatively young, even though she had made the decision to come out late. Thus, this was only her second drink. Giving it a quick swirl, Kim plucked the black stirrer from the glass and gently sucked the fizzy sweet and sour droplets from its length before neatly placing it down on the bar. She huffed when a few strands of her long red hair drooped down over her face. Even her own hair was choosing to mock her! Irately, she raised a hand and flicked it behind her ear.

                    How on earth had it come to this? Sitting alone in a bar on a Friday night, feeling sorry for herself, while her friends were probably only a few streets away and having a blast. Hell, Monique had even invited her to come with them the second she found out that her best girl was home. However, like most occasions recently, Kim had declined on the grounds of being stiff, sore and worn out from her latest string of missions. While sometimes true, tonight it had been a downright lie. She'd just had a shit week. Raising the glass in a mock toast to herself and all her crap, she took a sip and allowed the bubbles to fizzle out on her tongue; an apt metaphor for her own happiness after graduating high school. The beverage lit up both the sweet and sour centres of her taste buds before she swallowed.

                    Involuntarily, Kim's mind travelled back to that time before the Lorwardian invasion. To a time when happy was a default state, not a collection of scattered moments that she grasped whenever she could and struggled in vain to hold on to. <em>Screw those alien motherfuckers for showing up and ruining the world… ruining my life.</em> A hollow laugh escaped from behind her lips. <em>The Lorwardians might have fucked up the world, but you fucked up your own life quite nicely all by yourself; those aliens simply served as the catalyst.</em> She took a long drink and willed the effects of the alcohol to hurry up. Drunk Kim had the advantage of being unable to point out the harsh truths about her life. Unfortunately, until such time… <em>Do you honestly think things would have worked out any differently had the earth not been brought to its knees?</em>

                    She sighed and took another drink. She'd been down this particular road many times before, knew all the stops and knew exactly where it ended. And stop number one was always the same place… Bueno Nacho. She'd been sitting there with Ron and Rufus, as they had done on countless occasions before. Only this particular instance would probably forever be etched into her memory. There, on that day before graduation, she had sat and knowingly or not, downright lied to her best friend come boyfriend; she'd told him that nothing would change after the big day. How wrong she had been.
